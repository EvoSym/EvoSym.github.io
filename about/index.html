title: Symbioses in Evolution
---

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Welcome to our research on Symbioses in Evolution</h1>
	<p>Our research team at NIOZ aims to illuminate the deep roots of cellular life on Earth, the structure of the Tree of Life, as well as the role of symbioses in key transitions throughout cellular evolution. <br>
  	
	<ul>
	  <li><h3>How did the first cells look like? </h3></li><br>
	  <li><h3>Did a symbiotic interaction underlie the <b>origin of complex eukaryotic cells</b> such as those characterising animals, plants and fungi? </h3></li><br>
	  <li><h3>What role do members of the large radiation of putative archaeal symbionts referred to as <b>DPANN archaea</b> play in evolution and ecology? </h3></li><br>
	<ul>
	  
  	To address those questions, we combine computational, molecular, microbiology and microscopy approaches.</p>
