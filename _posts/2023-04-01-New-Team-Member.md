We are extremely happy to welcome <a href="https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/organisation/staff/dina-castillo-boukhchtaber">Dina</a> to our team. She will help with our experimental work on DPANN symbionts, with the aim to elucidate the evolutionary impact of the symbionts on host evolution. We are very much looking forward to working together. <br/>
