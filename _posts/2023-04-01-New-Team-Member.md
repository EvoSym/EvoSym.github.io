We are extremely happy to welcome <a href="https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/organisation/staff/dina-castillo-boukhchtaber">Dina</a> to our team. She will help with our experimental work on DPANN symbionts, with the aim to elucidate the evolutionary impact of nanohaloarchaeal symbionts on the evolution of their hosts. We are very much looking forward to working together. <br/>
